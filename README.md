This is the official implementation of "Deep Instruction Tuning for Segment Anything Model", which propose two simple yet effective deep instruction tuning (DIT) methods for text-guided SAM.





## Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
wget https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_vectors_web_lg-2.1.0/en_vectors_web_lg-2.1.0.tar.gz -O en_vectors_web_lg-2.1.0.tar.gz
pip install en_vectors_web_lg-2.1.0.tar.gz
```
## Data preparation

- Â Follow the instructions of  [DATA_PRE_README.md](https://github.com/luogen1996/SimREC/blob/main/DATA_PRE_README.md) to generate training data and testing data.

## Training and Evaluation 

1. Prepare your settings. To train a model, you should  modify ``./config/config.yaml``  to adjust the settings  you want. 
2. Train the model. run ` train.py`  under the main folder to start training:
```
python train.py --config ./config/config.yaml
```
3. Test the model.   Then, you can run ` test.py`  by
```
python test.py --eval-weights ./logs/dit/1/weights/seg_best.pth
```
4. Training log.  Logs are stored in ``./logs`` directory, which records the detailed training curve and accuracy per epoch. If you want to log the visualizations, please  set  ``LOG_IMAGE`` to ``True`` in ``config.yaml``.
